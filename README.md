# Heterogeneous Behaviors and Structural Resilience in Global Business Networks

This repository contains the computational framework, data-processing scripts, and topological–network analysis pipeline for the study:

**“Heterogeneous Behaviors and Structural Resilience in Global Business Networks.”**

Our project reconstructs annual firm–firm similarity networks from global corporate filings and investigates:
- Behavioral scaling patterns across industries and years  
- Structural heterogeneity and multi-scale network organization  
- Topological skeletons extracted via backbone filtering  
- Network resilience under targeted and random failures  
- Comparative insights from degree-based, centrality-based, and homology-based indicators

## ⚙️ **Main Methods**
- Network construction based on firm-level textual similarity  
- Backbone extraction using thresholding + community-based filtering  
- Louvain clustering for modular structures  
- GLMY directed homology and persistence-based indicators  
- Targeted vs. random failure simulations for resilience evaluation
